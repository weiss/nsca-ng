.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B nsca\-ng
server makes the Nagios command file accessible from remote systems.
This allows for submitting passive check results, downtimes, and many
other commands to Nagios (or compatible monitoring solutions).
The communication with clients is
.SM TLS
encrypted and authenticated using pre-shared keys (as per
.SM RFC
4279).
The
.B nsca\-ng
server supports per-client passwords and fine-grained authorization
control.
.
.PP
The server process rereads its configuration file when it receives a
hangup signal
.SM (SIGHUP)
by executing itself with the name and arguments it was started with.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BI \-b\  listen
.
Bind to the specified
.I listen
address or host name.
The default setting is \(lq*\(rq, which tells
.B nsca\-ng
to listen on all available interfaces.
A colon (\(lq:\(rq) followed by a service name or port number may be
appended in order to override the default port (5668) used by
.BR nsca\-ng .
If this option is specified, the
.B listen
setting in the
.BR nsca\-ng.cfg (5)
file is ignored.
.
.TP
.BI \-C\  file
.
Submit monitoring commands into the specified
.IR file .
This should be the named pipe
.SM (FIFO)
that Nagios checks for external commands to process.
By default,
.B nsca\-ng
submits commands into
.IR @localstatedir@/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd .
This option takes precedence over the
.B command_file
setting in the
.BR nsca\-ng.cfg (5)
file.
.
.TP
.BI \-c\  file
.
Read the configuration from the specified
.I file
instead of using the default configuration file
.IR @sysconfdir@/nsca\-ng.cfg .
If a directory is specified instead of a
.IR file ,
the configuration will be read from all files with a
.I .cfg
or
.I .conf
extension in this directory and all subdirectories.
Symbolic links are followed.
.
.TP
.B \-F
.
Don't detach from the controlling terminal, and write all messages to
the standard error output (unless the
.BR \-s
option is specified).
.
.TP
.B \-h
.
Print usage information to the standard output and exit.
.
.TP
.BI \-l\  level
.
Use the specified log
.IR level ,
which must be an integer value between 0 and 5 inclusive.
A value of 0 tells
.B nsca\-ng
to generate only fatal error messages, 1 adds non-fatal error messages,
2 adds warnings, 3 additionally spits out every submitted monitoring
command (plus startup and shutdown notices), 4 also logs each message
sent or received at the protocol level, and 5 generates additional debug
output.
The default log
.I level
is 3.
If this option is specified, the
.B log_level
setting in the
.BR nsca\-ng.cfg (5)
file is ignored.
.
.TP
.BI \-P\  file
.
During startup, try to create and lock the specified
.I file
and write the process
.SM ID
of the
.B nsca\-ng
daemon into it.
Bail out if another process holds a lock on the
.IR file .
By default, no such
.SM PID
.I file
is written.
This option takes precedence over the
.B pid_file
setting in the
.BR nsca\-ng.cfg (5)
file.
.
.TP
.B \-S
.
Write all messages to the standard error output and (with the exception
of startup messages) to the system logger.
This option may only be specified together with the
.B \-F
option.
.
.TP
.B \-s
.
Send all messages to the system logger, except for startup messages.
This is the default behaviour (unless the
.B \-F
option is specified).
.
.TP
.B \-V
.
Print version information to the standard output and exit.
.
.SH FILES

configuration file.
