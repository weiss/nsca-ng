Welcome to NSCA-ng!
===================

The NSCA-ng package provides a client-server pair which makes the `Nagios
command file' accessible from remote systems.  This allows for submitting
passive check results, downtimes, and many other commands to Nagios (or
compatible monitoring solutions).  See

	<http://www.nagios.org/developerinfo/externalcommands/>

for the full list of available commands.

NSCA-ng supports TLS encryption and shared-secret authentication with
client-specific passwords (based on RFC 4279), as well as fine-grained
authorization control.

Prerequisites
-------------

OpenSSL 1.0.0 or newer is required for building NSCA-ng (as older releases
don't support pre-shared key authentication).  OpenSSL can be obtained from:

	<http://www.openssl.org/>

This is the only hard dependency of the NSCA-ng client.  If the OpenSSL
version provided by your operating system vendor is too old, you might want
to build a private copy of OpenSSL and embed it into NSCA-ng.  This can
easily be done by running the `./build-aux/make-openssl' script, which
downloads the most recent OpenSSL version and installs it into the NSCA-ng
source tree.  The `./configure' script (see below) will then pick that up
automatically.

In addition to OpenSSL, the NSCA-ng server requires libConfuse 2.6 or newer,
as available from:

	<http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/>

In order to embed a private copy of libConfuse into NSCA-ng, you could run
the `./build-aux/make-confuse' script before calling `./configure'.

Also, if libev 4.00 or newer is pre-installed and found by the `./configure'
script, NSCA-ng will use it (by default).  Otherwise, a bundled copy of
libev is embedded into NSCA-ng (by default), so this dependency is optional.
The libev library can be downloaded from:

	<http://libev.schmorp.de/>

Installation
------------

If only the client should be built, issuing the following three commands in
NSCA-ng's source directory should do the trick:

	./configure
	make
	su root -c 'make install'

This installs the NSCA-ng client into appropriate subdirectories of
`/usr/local'.

The installation process can be customized by setting environment variables
and/or passing options to the `./configure' script.  Some of the more
frequently used `./configure' options include:

  --enable-server
  	Build and install the NSCA-ng server (in addition to the client,
  	unless `--disable-client' is specified).

  --disable-client
  	Don't build and install the NSCA-ng client.

  --disable-posix-aio
  	Don't use the POSIX AIO API.  By default, the NSCA-ng server will
  	use the POSIX AIO API if available.

  --prefix=PATH
  	Install NSCA-ng into subdirectories of `PATH' instead of
  	`/usr/local'.

  --with-confuse=PATH
  	Search for the libConfuse header files in `PATH'/include, and search
  	for the libConfuse library files in `PATH'/lib.  If this option
  	isn't specified, `./configure' will look for libConfuse in a few
  	typical locations.

  --with-ev=PATH
  	Search for the libev header files in `PATH'/include, and search for
  	the libev library files in `PATH'/lib.  If this option isn't
  	specified, `./configure' will look for libev in a few typical
  	locations; and if no usable version is found, a bundled copy of
  	libev will be embedded into NSCA-ng.  In order to force usage of the
  	included copy, `--with-ev=embedded' can be specified; while
  	`--with-ev=external' would disallow falling back to the bundled
  	libev code.

  --with-openssl=PATH
  	Search for the OpenSSL header files in `PATH'/include, and search
  	for the OpenSSL library files in `PATH'/lib.  If this option isn't
  	specified, `./configure' will look for OpenSSL in a few typical
  	locations.

For a full list of available options and environment variables, run
`./configure --help'.  See the file `INSTALL' for detailed installation
instructions.

Configuration
-------------

The NSCA-ng client is configured using the send_nsca.cfg(5) file, the
NSCA-ng server uses the nsca-ng.cfg(5) file.  Examples of these files are
installed if they don't already exist.

	IMPORTANT:  Please set the permissions of the configuration
	files appropriately to make sure that only authorized users
	can access them.

A script such as `nsca-ng.init' (as provided in the `contrib' directory of
this package) could be used to start and stop the NSCA-ng server.

Usage
-----

Please see the scripts in the `contrib' directory for various usage
examples.

Documentation
-------------

Detailed information regarding the build and installation process can be
found in the file `INSTALL'.

The NSCA-ng usage and configuration is documented in the nsca-ng(8),
send_nsca(8), nsca-ng.cfg(5), and send_nsca.cfg(5) manual pages.  The
commands `nsca-ng -h' and `send_nsca -h' spit out short summaries of the
available command line options.

For each release, noteworthy changes are listed in the file `NEWS'.  Feature
additions which are planned for future releases are added to the `TODO'
file.

For copyright and license information, see the file `COPYING'.
